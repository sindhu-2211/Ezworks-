In the past two decades, technology has transformed the way people live, work, and communicate. In 2005, only about 1 billion people worldwide had access to the internet. By 2025, that number is expected to surpass 5.5 billion, representing nearly 70% of the global population. The average household now owns at least 3 internet-connected devices, compared to just 1 device per household in 2010.

Mobile technology has also seen dramatic growth. In 2010, there were around 5 billion mobile phone subscriptions globally. As of 2024, this figure has increased to over 8.6 billion, meaning there are more mobile subscriptions than people on the planet.

Furthermore, the average person spends 7 hours per day online, with 2.5 hours dedicated to social media platforms.

The impact of technology on education is equally significant. In 2023, over 300 million students participated in online learning programs, a huge jump from just 16 million in 2010. Schools and universities now invest an average of $120 per student each year on digital resources. Experts predict that by 2030, at least 80% of all educational content will be delivered digitally.

Despite these advances, challenges remain. Approximately 2.5 billion people still do not have reliable internet access, and the digital divide between urban and rural areas is significant.

Governments and organizations are working to close this gap by investing over $50 billion annually in infrastructure and training programs..
